= Applying a Custom Design System Theme

See instructions for <<{articles}/ds/customization/custom-theme#,creating a custom theme>>, and for <<{articles}/ds/customization/custom-theme-packaging#,packaging it as a JAR file>>.
Typically the JAR is then installed into a Maven repository like Maven Central or a local repository.

The dependency is then added to the [filename]#pom.xml# in the project's root folder:

.[filename]#pom.xml#
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>exampletheme</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Next, the theme needs to be applied to the component samples.
Change the <<{articles}/ds/customization/custom-theme/#applying-a-custom-theme, `@Theme` annotation>> in `src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/DemoExporter.java`:

.[filename]#src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/DemoExporter.java#
[source,java]
----
@Theme("exampletheme")
public abstract class DemoExporter<T extends Component> extends WebComponentExporter<T> {
  ...
}
----

The website needs to be rebuilt, or restarted in development mode, in order for this change to take effect.

.Application Theme vs Website Theme
[NOTE]
This section is about the theme used for rendered UI samples, which is distinct from the documentation website's styles covered in the <<customization#,Site Customization>> documentation.
